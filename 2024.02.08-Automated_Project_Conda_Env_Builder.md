# Project Workflow to create a tool with Copilot in VScode 
    Workflow Methodology (Steps to create a tool)
        
    6D Agile Software Develop - define, design, develop, debug, document, deliver

### Learning Goals and Deliverables: 
    a) Step through 6D-Agile Product Define-to-Deliver Process 
    b) Create utility to automatically setup working conda environment when starting a new development project
    c) post-project goal stretch goal: articulate requirements for a "meta-tool" to automate build similar scope tools

# Project Title: Automated [conda] Project Environment Builder 

## [Brainstorm Project Idea]

## Define Phase [Purpose and Requirements]

### Project Purpose: Create End-to-end Automated Tool to generate Python script that builds a new conda environment from a project repository package.

### Setup Project Development Tools
    1) Open VSCode
    2) Create New Workspace with the Name for New Project
    3) Develop and flesh out "Project Description"

### Define and Describe Project Purpose & Requirements
    1) create a catchy project title 
    2) articulate 1-paragraph description that:
        a) defines the "business problem"
        b) describes technical solution to solve business problem
    3) articulate project scrope, requirements, and constraints

## Design Phase

### High-Level Design 
    High-level description of the workflow 

#### Detailed Design: 

##### Project Workflow - Define Detailed Steps: 

    2) Search for pre-existing packages that fit the bill
         Don't reinvent the wheel - find something already available that meets the requirements
    3) Select existing that meets the initial requirements
    4) Download the best fitting package

    4b) user-specifies project folder name - function: get_new_project_name()
    5) unzip the best fitting package into new project folder [with a user-specified name]
            function: unzip_starter_project_repo()
    6) scan the project folder to find the (unique) set of required Python package dependencies
            function: scan_project_modules()
            py_dependencies_set
    7) scan our local pre-existing virtual environments to see which fits the dependency tree the best.
            function: scan_existing_env()
            current_env_dependencies_set
    8) decide whether to use or clone a pre-existing virtual environment or create a new one?
        Does an existing environment have required "current enough" packages to stand up the project?
            function: measure_env_fit() ? 
    9) use "conda search" to see if each package dependency is available in conda-channel priority: 
            search function: 1) search_conda_forge(), 2) search_anaconda(), 3) search_pip()
            a) conda-forge     (set of packages IN conda-forge)
            b) anaconda        (set of packages NOT IN conda-forge, but anaconda)
            c) pip             (set of packages NOT IN (conda-forge OR anaconda)

    10) iterate over step 9 until all (new) packages and required versions are found
            a) build list of repos (conda-forge, anaconda, CONDA-OTHER, or pip) containing required versions 
                function: build_repos_lists()

    12) create Python functions (or separate script commands?) needed to execute the environment build steps.

        a) conda create "core" environment using as many conda-forge packages as possible
            Example: conda create -n new_env -c conda-forge python, conda, etc.

        b) conda activate new_env

        c) conda install -c conda-forge ... all the other packages
            [conda install -c anaconda (???)]
            [conda install -c conda-OTHER

        d) pip install ... all remaining packages that are NOT available in conda format

    13) Build final script to execute The 12 Steps 
    14) Test final script
    15) Deliver

##### Project Object Model: 
    new_project_dependency_set

    existing_env_package_set  - (for v1, assume we inquire about only one preexisting env)

    conda_forge_pkg_list
    anaconda_pkg_list
    pip_only_pkg_list

##### Functions API Model

    Extract functions identified above in Project Workflow - Define Detailed Steps: 

## Develop Phase (TBD)

### **FEED PROJECT OVERVIEW, DETAILED DESIGN (WORKFLOW AND OBJECT MODEL)**

### **use the following (possibly redundant) text with the section above: "Project Workflow - Define Detailed Steps">>

    Create a Python program to sequentially search for a Python conda packages list provided by the user. 

    Use "conda search" for conda-only versions of packages in the "conda-forge" channel,

    Use "conda search" infor "anaconda" channel. 

    Build a list of the latest versions of packages is available in each repository (conda-forge, anaconda, pip), 

    Finally search pip for the remaining Python packages that do not have a current conda package, and build a Python function to install the remaining packages.

    Prioritize the installation commands:
        "conda install -c conda-forge" packages first 
        "conda install -c anaconda" packages next 
        "pip install <pip-only package names>"

    Critical "robustness" requirements:  
        Add fault-tolerance and error-checking, 
        Log process to a time-stamped file 

    Provide output report files as a markdown or HTML text file(s) for final lists of packages pulled and installed from conda-forge, anaconda, and pip.  

    Display final reports:
        In web browser (Markdown/HTML format). 
        In Notepad++ (Markdown format, for editing)



## Debug (test) Phase
    Get core functionality tested
    Enhance with important features missed earlier


## Document Phase

## Deliver Phase




# FOLLOW-ON PROJECT USING LANGCHAIN 

Purpose: Build Automated Tool for Building Tools
    A Lower-code forms-driven way to automate the process of building  tools and utilities using LLMs

MetaTool Creation Meta-Workflow:

This could be part of a suite of automated intelligent software "project accelerators".
